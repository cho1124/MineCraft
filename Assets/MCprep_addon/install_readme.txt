HOW TO INSTALL

If you are reading this text file, then you’re already a step in the wrong direction. This addon must be installed as a .zip file, do not unzip it.

— If your webbrowers automatically unzips zip files when downloaded, please *disable* that setting and re-download the addon. You may also try re-zipping/compressing the addon yourself, but this sometimes does not work.
- This is a known thing for safari users on macs. Please re-download with "auto-open file when download completes" turned off.

In blender, version 2.75 and up:
1) go to file > addons
2) then select the 4th tab (Addons),
3) Press "install Add-on from file" button at the bottom
4) Navigate to where the zip file is, select it
5) Press install addon
6) If MCprep does not show up immediately, search for it in the text box top / left
7) Press the check box to enable the addon
8) You are automatically opted into anonymous user tracking, but you can opt out by going to MCprep preferences > tracking > opt-out
9) Press `Save User Settings` so you don’t have to enable it every time you open blender (opting out/into user tracking will always save automatically even if you don't press `save user settings`)
